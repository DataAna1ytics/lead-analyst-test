## Software Engineer Intern Competency Test

Write a simple web application that reads data from Flickr's public feeds and displays the images on the page to the user.
Please check the Flickr API documentation from the following URL:

- [Flickr]( http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/)
- [Public feed](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne)

## Instruction

- Write the application in Flask/Django. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are Python based web frameworks. We recommend the Flask but you can use the Django if you prefer that way.
- On page load the applications should load the public feed images in either a list or grid view. You can use the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make your application look good. 
- The user should be able to enter a keyword in a search box and click on a search button and the app should return images with the relevant tags.
- Use any other third party library of your choice if needed - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or a [Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
- Please use the Python [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
- Put your code on GitHub, make it public and share the URL with Datalicious team. Please do not ask questions.

Design to impress, we would like to see you use [ajax](http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/), avoid page reloading on clicking like or searchâ€‹ Make the page look nice and slick, we are looking for well tested, neat and self documented code.
